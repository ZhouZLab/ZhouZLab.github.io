Postdoctoral Associate Kousuke Mouri's first author paper "Prioritization of autoimmune disease-associated genetic variants that perturb regulatory element activity in T cells" is now out at [Nature Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01056-5). Using MPRA, 18,000 GWAS variants across 6 T-cell autoimmune diseases were tested for functional activity, leading to the identification of 60 putatively causal variants and development of a mouse model for the risk allele of a prioritized variant near BACH2. This work was in collaboration with Dr. John Rayâ€™s laboratory at the Benaroya Research Institute.
