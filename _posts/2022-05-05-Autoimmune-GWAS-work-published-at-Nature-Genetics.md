Postdoctoral Associate Kousuke Mouri's first author paper "Prioritization of autoimmune disease-associated genetic variants that perturb regulatory element activity in T cells" is now out at [Nature Genetics] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01056-5). Using MPRA, 18,000 GWAS variants across 6 T-cell autoimmune diseases were tested for functional activity, leading to the identification of 60 putatively causal variants. Consequently, the risk allele of a prioritized variant was introduced into a human T cell line, resulting in reduced BACH2 expression. Naive CD8 T cells from mice containing this deletion also showed reduced expression of genes that suppress activation and maintain stemless. Upon viral infection, these cells also showed a greater tendency to become effector T cells. This work was in collaboration with Dr. John Rayâ€™s laboratory at the Benaroya Research Institute.
