Since COVID-19 upturned  many people's summer/internship plans (Natalia's included- she was initially intending to spend a couple weeks working on wildlife conservation in Madagascar!), Mike McKernan let her know there's a way for former SSP students to secure a second consecutive year of funding through the NSF. It was kind of a stop-and-go process trying to submit this secondary NSF proposal, since it seemed that for a while the NSF was only interested in funding COVID-related projects. Luckily for Natalia (and the lab, since Dr. Tewhey VERY graciously initially proposed funding her through a lab grant), the NSF changed its mind and allowed Natalia to submit a proposal! Her 2020 JAX fellowship is currently funded by NSF REU awarded through JAX Genomic Education.

She is using the funds to take a deeper look at the sequences she tested in the BODA (Bayesian Optimization of DNA activity) MPRA from last summer, using computer programs and software designed to analyze synthetic and genomic sequences for presence of transcription factor motifs. With that information she'll be able to compare MPRA activity measurements with underlying TFs, and get a better understanding for what elements BODA prioritizes in designing synthetic regulatory elements. Lots of cool stuff to look at when you have both sequence and activity info, woo MPRA!
