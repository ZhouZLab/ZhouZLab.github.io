We are excited to start a new project with the Siggers and Emili labs at Boston University looking at how cis-regulatory elements are impacted by genetic variation associated with autoimmune diseases. This work is funded by a new R01 awarded to the Siggers lab from the NIH/NIAID. We're looking forward to a fun five years exploring the regulatory architecture of these regions!
