COVID-19 has upturned many people's summer/internship plans including Natalia's. She was initially intending to spend the summer break working on wildlife conservation in Madagascar! Unfortunately, the program was cancelled but lucky for all of us she is back in Maine and will continue working in the lab this summer. Natalia also applied for NSF funding and was recently awarded a fellowship for the summer! Natalia will be extending the work she started last summer as an SSP student investigating synthetic regulatory elements.
