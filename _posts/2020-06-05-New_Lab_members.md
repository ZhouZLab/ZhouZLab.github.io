We would like to welcome our new lab members John and Luke who did rotations with us over the winter. John joins us from the Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering at the University of Maine, and Luke joins us from Tufts. Both will be working on continuations of their rotation projects, and we look forward to seeing where they will go!
