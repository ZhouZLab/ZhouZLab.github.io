Postdoc Kousuke Mouri is a first author on a new preprint in collaboration with Dr. John Ray's laboratory at the Benaroya Research Institute using MPRA to localize genome wide association signals of T-cell mediated autoimmune disorders. In addition, we knock-out a cis-regulatory element that influences expression of Bach2 and show it plays a role in CD8 T-cell biology. You can read the preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.30.445673v1.abstract).
