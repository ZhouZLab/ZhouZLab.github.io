# Welcome to the Tewhey Lab
###### We are a group of human geneticist, molecular biologists and computational scientists interested in understanding how genetic variation impacts human traits and risk to disease.
###### Our lab is located in the Snell Building on the Bar Harbor Campus of The Jackson Laboratory.

### What's new with us?

_11-06-2022_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **New Lab Members in the Tewhey Lab!** <br>
We would like to welcome our new lab members Niketa and Frank! Niketa is a first year PhD student in the Tufts Mammalian Genetics program at JAX and Frank is a summer student in the JAX Summer Student Program. You can learn more about Frank and Niketa [here](https://www.tewheylab.org/members/).

_29-06-2021_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **HCR-FlowFISH work published at Nature Genetics** <br>
Our work describing HCR-FlowFISH as a flexible phenotyping methods for CRISPR non-coding screens is now out at [Nature Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00900-4). Our article made the cover with a beautiful illustration from our friends at [SciStories](https://scistories.com/). Check it out [here](https://www.nature.com/ng/volumes/53/issues/8). This work was a collaboration between the Sabeti Lab at the Broad Institute and the Reilly Lab at Yale University.

_30-05-2021_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **Autoimmune GWAS MPRA Preprint** <br>
Postdoc Kousuke Mouri is a first author on a new preprint in collaboration with Dr. John Ray's laboratory at the Benaroya Research Institute using MPRA to localize genome wide association signals of T-cell mediated autoimmune disorders. In addition, we knock-out a cis-regulatory element that influences expression of Bach2 and show it plays a role in CD8 T-cell biology. You can read the preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.30.445673v1.abstract). 

_11-02-2021_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **Front page of the Portland Press Herald** <br>
The Tewhey Lab's partnership with the Maine CDC was featured on the front page of the PPH in an article describing how Maine is well prepared for COVID-19 genomic surveillance.
