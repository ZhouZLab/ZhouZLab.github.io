# Welcome to the Tewhey Lab!


We are located in Snell Building at the Bar Harbor Campus of The Jackson Laboratory.


### What's new with us?

#### Covid-19 Sequencing

The Tewhey Lab is working with the Maine CDC to sequence the positive Covid-19 cases within the state of Maine. We are working to develop a narrative of what is going on epidemiologically in order to help the CDC better understand the Covid-19 situation in Maine.
