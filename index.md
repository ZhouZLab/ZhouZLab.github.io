# Welcome to the Tewhey Lab!


We are located in Snell Building at the Bar Harbor Campus of The Jackson Laboratory.


### What's new with us?

**Covid-19 Sequencing** <br>
_10-06-2020_

The Tewhey Lab is working with the Maine CDC to sequence the positive Covid-19 cases within the state of Maine. We are working to develop a narrative of what is going on epidemiologically in order to help the CDC better understand the Covid-19 situation in Maine.


**New Lab Members** <br>
_05-06-2020_

We would like to welcome our new lab members John and Luke who did rotations with us over the winter. John joins us from the Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering at the University of Maine, and Luke joins us from Tufts. Both will be working on continuations of their rotation projects, and we look forward to seeing where they will go!

**NSF Fellowship Awarded** <br>
_01-06-2020_

Since COVID-19 upturned  many people's summer/internship plans (Natalia's included- she was initially intending to spend a couple weeks working on wildlife conservation in Madagascar!), Mike McKernan let her know there's a way for former SSP students to secure a second consecutive year of funding through the NSF. It was kind of a stop-and-go process trying to submit this secondary NSF proposal, since it seemed that for a while the NSF was only interested in funding COVID-related projects. Luckily for Natalia (and the lab, since Dr. Tewhey VERY graciously initially proposed funding her through a lab grant), the NSF changed its mind and allowed Natalia to submit a proposal! Her 2020 JAX fellowship is currently funded by NSF REU awarded through JAX Genomic Education.

She is using the funds to take a deeper look at the sequences she tested in the BODA (Bayesian Optimization of DNA activity) MPRA from last summer, using computer programs and software designed to analyze synthetic and genomic sequences for presence of transcription factor motifs. With that information she'll be able to compare MPRA activity measurements with underlying TFs, and get a better understanding for what elements BODA prioritizes in designing synthetic regulatory elements. Lots of cool stuff to look at when you have both sequence and activity info, woo MPRA!

**Pre-Print Announcement** <br>
_13-05-2020_

We have released our preprint on bioRxiv describing HCR-FlowFISH, a flexible phenotyping method for CRISPRi/a screens of cis-regulatory elements. This project is in collaboration with Steve Reilly and Pardis Sabeti at the Broad Institute and part of our work as an ENCODE Characterization Center.
