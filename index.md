# Welcome to the Tewhey Lab!


We are located in Snell Building at the Bar Harbor Campus of The Jackson Laboratory.


### What's new with us?

**Covid-19 Sequencing** <br>
_10-06-2020_

The Tewhey Lab is working with the Maine CDC to sequence the positive Covid-19 cases within the state of Maine. We are working to develop a narrative of what is going on epidemiologically in order to help the CDC better understand the Covid-19 situation in Maine.


**New Lab Members** <br>
_05-06-2020_

We would like to welcome our new lab members John and Luke who did rotations with us over the winter. John joins us from the Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering at the University of Maine, and Luke joins us from Tufts. Both will be working on continuations of their rotation projects, and we look forward to seeing where they will go!

**Pre-Print Announcement** <br>
_13-05-2020_

We have released our preprint on bioRxiv describing HCR-FlowFISH, a flexible phenotyping method for CRISPRi/a screens of cis-regulatory elements. This project is in collaboration with Steve Reilly and Pardis Sabeti at the Broad Institute and part of our work as an ENCODE Characterization Center.

**Natalia Returns and NSF Fellowship Awarded** <br>
_09-05-2020_

COVID-19 has upturned many people's summer/internship plans including Natalia's. She was initially intending to spend the summer break working on wildlife conservation in Madagascar! Unfortunately, the program was cancelled but lucky for all of us she is back in Maine and will continue working in the lab this summer. Natalia also applied for NSF funding and was recently awarded a fellowship for the summer! Natalia will be extending the work she started last summer as an SSP student investigating synthetic regulatory elements.
