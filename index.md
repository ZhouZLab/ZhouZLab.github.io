# Welcome to the Tewhey Lab
###### We are a group of human geneticist, molecular biologists and computational scientists interested in understanding how genetic variation impacts human traits and risk to disease.
###### Our lab is located in the Snell Building on the Bar Harbor Campus of The Jackson Laboratory.

### What's new with us?

_11-06-2022_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **New members of the Tewhey Lab!** <br>
We would like to welcome our new lab members Niketa and Frank! Niketa is a first year PhD student in the Tufts Mammalian Genetics program at JAX and Frank is a summer student in the JAX Summer Student Program. You can learn more about Frank and Niketa [here](https://www.tewheylab.org/members/).

_05-05-2022_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **Autoimmune GWAS work published at Nature Genetics** <br>
Postdoctoral Associate Kousuke Mouri's first author paper "Prioritization of autoimmune disease-associated genetic variants that perturb regulatory element activity in T cells" is now out at [Nature Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01056-5). Using MPRA, 18,000 GWAS variants across 6 T-cell autoimmune diseases were tested for functional activity, leading to the identification of 60 putatively causal variants and development of a mouse model for the risk allele of a  Consequently, the risk prioritized variant near BACH2. This work was in collaboration with Dr. John Rayâ€™s laboratory at the Benaroya Research Institute. 

_05-05-2022_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **Tewhey Lab featured on the JAX website** <br>
The Tewhey Lab was featured on the JAX website. Read the article [here](https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2022/may/genome-explorer) to learn more about our work on regulatory elements, collaborative efforts on Type II Diabetes and auto-immune disease, and Ryan's scientific journey. 

_11-02-2022_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **MPRAduo Preprint** <br>
Our work on characterizing genome-wide RE1 silencers using MPRAduo is out on Biorxiv. Our team modified MPRA to test repressive elements and characterized ~13000 human RE1. You can read the preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.11.479757v1)
