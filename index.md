# Welcome to the ZhouLab
###### Welcome to the Zhou Lab at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University.  We are committed to the cutting-edge cell biology and nanomedicine research. We are driven by a passion for discovery at the intersection of nanomedicine, vascular biology, and pulmonary research. Our mission is to develop innovative, cell-targeted therapies to treat a wide range of lung diseases.


###### Our lab combines advanced drug delivery technologies, molecular biology, and interdisciplinary collaboration to uncover the mechanisms of disease and pioneer new treatment strategies. We aim to translate our discoveries into real-world solutions that improve lung health and patient outcomes.


###### Explore our research, meet the team, and learn more about our journey to shape the future of lung-targeted nanomedicine.


###### Our lab is located in the Medical Education & Research Building (Floor 11) on the Medical Campus of Temple University.

### What's new with us?
_2-06-2023_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **Ryan gives promotion seminar for Associate Professor at JAX** <br>
Congratulations to Ryan, who just gave his promotion seminar for Associate Professor at JAX! The title of his talk was "Defining the genetic basis of complex traits and disease through the (de)coding of regulatory syntax." 


_12-16-2022_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **MPRAduo out now in Cell Genomics!** <br>
Our work on characterizing genome-wide RE1 silencers using MPRAduo is out in Cell Genomics! Our team, lead by post-doc Kousuke Mouri, modified MPRA to test repressive elements and characterized ~13000 human RE1. You can read the paper [here](https://www.cell.com/cell-genomics/pdfExtended/S2666-979X(22)00192-6)


_05-05-2022_ &nbsp; &nbsp; **Autoimmune GWAS work published at Nature Genetics** <br>
Postdoctoral Associate Kousuke Mouri's first author paper "Prioritization of autoimmune disease-associated genetic variants that perturb regulatory element activity in T cells" is now out at [Nature Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01056-5). Using MPRA, 18,000 GWAS variants across 6 T-cell autoimmune diseases were tested for functional activity, leading to the identification of 60 putatively causal variants and development of a mouse model for the risk allele of a prioritized variant near BACH2. This work was in collaboration with Dr. John Rayâ€™s laboratory at the Benaroya Research Institute.
