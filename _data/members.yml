  description: "Ryan is a human geneticist with expertise in developing large-scale screening methods to understand how genetic variation \
  impacts human traits and disease. His primary focus is the investigation of non-coding regions of the genome that control gene expression. \
  He has pioneered the use of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) and CRISPR based screens of non-coding regions to identify causal \
  alleles from genome wide association studies. His broad interests lie in the application of novel technologies to answer questions related \
  to human health and disease. His time is evenly divided between experimental and computational approaches. \

  Ryan completed his undergraduate degree from the University of Maine, Orono. He received his PhD from the University of California, San Diego \
  in 2012 while carrying out work at The Scripps Research Translational Institute. He completed is postdoctoral work at Harvard University and \
  The Broad Institute. His awards include Forbes Magazine's 30 under 30, NSF/A-STAR EAPSI fellow, the Charles J. Epstein Award for Research \
  Excellence by the American Society of Human Genetics, and an NHGRI Pathway to Independence Award. Ryan is currently an assistant professor \
  at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor and holds appointments at Tufts University School of Medicine and The University of Maine Graduate \
  School of Biomedical Science and Engineering. "
