  He has pioneered the use of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) and CRISPR based screens of non-coding regions to identify causal \
  alleles from genome wide association studies. His broad interests lie in the application of novel technologies to answer questions related \
  to human health and disease. His time is evenly divided between experimental and computational approaches. \

  Ryan completed his undergraduate degree from the University of Maine, Orono. He received his PhD from the University of California, San Diego \
  in 2012 while carrying out work at The Scripps Research Translational Institute. He completed is postdoctoral work at Harvard University and \
