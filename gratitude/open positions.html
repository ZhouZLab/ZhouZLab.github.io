  <h3>Postdoctoral Fellow Opportunities:</h3>
  <p>We are currently seeking <strong>two</strong> highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellows to join our interdisciplinary team focused on advancing the understanding and treatment of inflammatory lung diseases. Our lab integrates cutting-edge approaches in lung biology, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and nanomedicine to develop targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>

  <p><strong>Position 1: Postdoctoral Fellow – Lung Biology & Molecular Mechanisms</strong></p>
  <p>We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher with strong expertise in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Molecular biology techniques (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9, qPCR, Western blot, RNA-seq)</li>
    <li>Bioinformatics and sequencing data analysis</li>
    <li>Lung biology, particularly endothelial and epithelial cell biology</li>
    <li>Experience with mouse models of lung injury or inflammation is a plus</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This position will focus on understanding cell-specific signaling mechanisms in the lung and their role in inflammatory lung diseases such as lung injury and ARDS.</p>

  <p><strong>Position 2: Postdoctoral Fellow – Drug Delivery & Nanomedicine</strong></p>
  <p>We are seeking a postdoc with a background in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drug delivery systems, particularly lipid nanoparticles</li>
    <li>mRNA delivery and nucleic acid therapeutics</li>
    <li>Nanomedicine design and characterization</li>
    <li>In vitro and in vivo evaluation of delivery platforms</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This project involves the development of lung-targeted nanotherapies for treating acute and chronic lung diseases, with opportunities to translate findings into preclinical models.</p>

  <p>If you're passionate about interdisciplinary research and want to contribute to innovative solutions for lung disease, we'd love to hear from you!</p>

  <p>To apply, please send your CV, a brief statement of research interests, and contact information for 3 references to: <a href="mailto:zhouzhj09@uchicago.edu">zhouzhj09@uchicago.edu</a></p>

  <h3>Undergraduate Student Opportunities:</h3>
  <p>We encourage undergraduate students to reach out if they are interested in joining the lab through research programs, thesis projects, or for academic credit via work-study opportunities.</p>

  <p>We strongly encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds, and we value diversity in our team.</p>
