We are actively looking for passionate and motivated scientists to join our team. Please check below for current openings and contact us directly to inquire about the opportunities.

### Graduate Student Opportunities:
We are currently recruiting motivated and curious graduate students to join our team.
Ideal candidates will have:
- A background in biomedical sciences, nanomedicine, molecular biology, etc.
- Passion for research and a strong work ethic
- Willingness to work in a team-oriented, dynamic setting
- Prior research experience is a plus but not required

Interested candidates should send CV and Contact information for 3 references to: zhouzhj09@uchicago.edu

  
### Postdoctoral Fellow Opportunities:
We are currently seeking <Strong>two</Strong> highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellows to join our interdisciplinary team focused on advancing the understanding and treatment of inflammatory lung diseases. Our lab integrates cutting-edge approaches in lung biology, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and nanomedicine to develop targeted therapeutic strategies.

<Strong>Position 1</Strong>: Postdoctoral Fellow – Lung Biology & Molecular Mechanisms
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher with strong expertise in:
- Molecular biology techniques (e.g., CRISPR/Cas9, qPCR, Western blot, RNA-seq)
- Bioinformatics and sequencing data analysis
- Lung biology, particularly endothelial and epithelial cell biology
- Experience with mouse models of lung injury or inflammation is a plus

This position will focus on understanding cell-specific signaling mechanisms in the lung and their role in inflammatory lung diseases such as lung injury and ARDS.

<Strong>Position 2</Strong>: Postdoctoral Fellow – Drug Delivery & Nanomedicine
We are seeking a postdoc with a background in:
- Drug delivery systems, particularly lipid nanoparticles
- mRNA delivery and nucleic acid therapeutics
- Nanomedicine design and characterization
- In vitro and in vivo evaluation of delivery platforms

This project involves the development of lung-targeted nanotherapies for treating acute and chronic lung diseases, with opportunities to translate findings into preclinical models.

If you're passionate about interdisciplinary research and want to contribute to innovative solutions for lung disease, we’d love to hear from you!

To apply, please send your CV, a brief statement of research interests, and contact information for 3 references to: zhouzhj09@uchicago.edu
    
We strongly encourage applications from individuals of all backgrounds, and we value diversity in our team.
